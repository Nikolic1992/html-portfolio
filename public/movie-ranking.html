<h1>The best movies according to Stevan the king of HTML :D</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>

<p>I clearly love Di Caprios acting. The best part of the movie is that you do not know if they were dreaming or not.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>

<p>I am simply a huge fan of this science fiction movie. I love the Hobbit as well but not as much as LOTR.</p>

<h3>The Gladiator</h3>

<p>Movie rating tells you everything. </p>
